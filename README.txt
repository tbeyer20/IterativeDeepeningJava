My program reads an adjacency matrix from input.txt.  My src files are in the algorithms folder.  They files include 3 .java files including IterativeDeepening.java, DFS.java, and nodes.java.
REPORT.txt includes a report on algorithm techniques used by the java files to search through the adjacency matrix. 

Problem 1: [COMPLETE]

Problem 2: [COMPLETE]
